An in person meeting would be preferable,\n\n   but whatever is available with your schedule is fine.  My understanding\n   is that he is not formally looking for a job\n\n   yet, but trying to get a feel for different types of positions available\n   within the energy industry. Erik is the son of\n\n   one of Russell's clients and will graduate from school in May.  I will\n   try to get more color from Russell and forward it\n\n   to you.\n\n   -----Original Message-----\n\n   From: Kevin.M.Presto@enron.com [mailto:Kevin.M.Presto@enron.com\n   <mailto:Kevin.M.Presto@enron.com>]\n\n   Sent: Monday, February 04, 2002 4:18 PM\n\n   To: Baker, James+\n\n   Subject: RE: meeting with Erik Fabrikant\n\n\n   What do you need from me?
